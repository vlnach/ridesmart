# RideSmart – Learn Cycling Rules in the Netherlands

 About the project
This website was created as part of the HackYourFuture application assignment.  
Its purpose is to help immigrants and newcomers better understand Dutch cycling safety rules through a lightweight, mobile-friendly interface and an interactive quiz.

Inspiration
I was inspired by the websites of Dutch bike manufacturers like VanMoof and others. I used a basic template as a foundation, but adapted it heavily to fit my own concept, structure, and goals.

 Technologies used
- HTML5
- CSS3 (including Flexbox)
- JavaScript (for light/dark mode and quiz logic) 

Personal story
I started working on this project while traveling in Poland. Despite the trip, I kept pushing forward and worked on the website 2 – 8 hours per day, from various locations. After returning to the Netherlands, I focused on cleaning up the code and finalizing the concept. I spend more time for Design than JS. 

The most difficult part was implementing quiz logic using JavaScript. While I didn’t fully succeed in making the buttons functional yet, this is the maximum I could do within the time constraints. I’m still try think how i can impove the result.

 Key learnings
- I learned that "structure is my key for freedom".  In the future, I’ll structure my time better using clear time blocks.
- I also understood how much I can do even under pressure, when I focus on consistent progress.

 Status
- Responsive: yep
- Theme toggle: yep  
- Quiz section: on work (partially working — main logic sketched)
- Code: yep = Self-written HTML, CSS and basic JS + tried to make it more semantic
